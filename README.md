# network-api

## Description

This project was build as a way for users to be able to connect with other users by sharing their thoughts, reacting, and even adding them to their own friends list. Building this project, I got more practiced using insomnia, use NoSQL database, mongoDB and mongoose, for the first time, getting a better understanding on how it works and differs from SQL. 

## Installation

To get the code to work properly, you will need to do the following steps in the intergrated terminal:
- npm init -y
- npm i express
- npm i mongoose

Afterwards you can type node index.js to get the code to start running.

## Usage

As shown in the demo video, you are able to create, update, or delete users and thoughts. You can also make a friend list where you add or remove users from that list and be able to react to other user's thought and delete it if needed.
